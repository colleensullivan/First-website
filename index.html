  <br/>My kids play <strong> a ridiculous amount </strong> of hockey. They attend Near North Montessori School in Chicago. 
  
  <h2>Rosie</h2> 
  
  <p>Rosie plays hockey on two teams, an all boys (except for her) team and, at age 9, <a href= "http://www.chicagojetshockey.org/roster_players/6023684?subseason=182798">an all girls 12 year-old team.</a>  Rosie was one of 100 kids in the State of Illinois invited to try out for the <a href= "http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=75787">Brick Tournament.</a>  Only two girls were selected for the tryouts.  Rosie made the second round of cuts - down to 60 skaters - and skates again on the evening of Monday, January 19th.  I will be late for class that night so I can support / watch her.  Rosie also loves to <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm8EMIYFjhY">ski.</a> <br>If I wanted a quick fix to my many validation errors, I could have asked Rosie for assistance.  But, that would be cheating.  Here is Rosie <a href = "http://cohen.nnms.org/?p=686"> attempting to teach me how to code.</a> </p>

  <h2>Mack</h2>
  
  <p>Here is Mack <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EejcPaje6rA&amp;list=UUaH6uvSK9YU9dcXHqRFhv1Q"> at age 3 1/2.</a> Mack is now 8 1/2.  Mack is a twin, plays hockey, and is proud to be dyslexic, which we view as an "ability" with special gifts versus a "disability."  He is a fantastically talented lego builder and can do some cool Minecraft coding on his Kano computer.  He can build <strong> anything / everything.</strong>
  <br/>Mack was a day of the dead storm trooper a couple years ago for Halloween.  He made the special "puff ball" blaster and most of the sugar skulls. <img src = "http://www.kleinchaos.com/Klein_Chaos/Photos_and_Videos/Pages/A_Months_Worth_of_Chaos_files/Media/IMG_0403/IMG_0403.jpg?disposition=download" alt = "Mack"/></p> 
    
  <h2>Sadie</h2>
    
  <p>Sadie, Mack's twin, is also 8 1/2.  She loves hockey and, to my husband's dismay, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aii5zM4RDKg&amp;feature=youtu.be"> dancing.</a>  In the preceding video, Sadie plays "Annie" and she spends a lot of time not being "ok" in the elevator shaft.  It's a must watch, if you are into Michael Jackson.  Sadie loves animals more than humans, a fine trait, in my opinion.  She is well versed in X-Men comics, another fine trait.  Sadie is also a fantastic skier.  Here we are in Big Sky, Montana <img src= "http://www.kleinchaos.com/Klein_Chaos/Photos_and_Videos/Pages/Happy_2013%21_files/Media/IMG_0697/IMG_0697.jpg?disposition=download" alt= "Sadie"/></p>
